# Project_2 - In Your Neighborhood Marketing App

Our project consist of Crime reporting visualization. Our marketing app will share with homeowners in the Orlando City Limits what neighborhoods, time and day theft and robbery occurs the most. 

We used an API to call Orlando Crime Data, using Flask to drop it into MongoDB and call the data we need to populate the javascript files. Plus, we used Jquery to populate plots and map graph.

Here is a link to the dataset: https://data.cityoforlando.net/resource/4y9m-jbmz.json


To run the app:

1. You'll need to have MongoDB installed
2. Run pulldata.py first
3. Check to make sure your database is created in MongoDB
4. Run app.py
5. Type: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser
6. Have Fun Clicking Away!
